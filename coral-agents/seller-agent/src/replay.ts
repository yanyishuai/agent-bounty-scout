/**
 * Guard against payment-signature replay.
 *
 * `verifyPayment` confirms a transaction paid the right amount to the right wallet - but that alone
 * lets a buyer reuse **one** paid transaction as proof for **many** requests (same amount + recipient
 * verifies every time). This records consumed signatures and rejects reuse, so each on-chain payment
 * settles exactly one order.
 *
 * In-memory only: a restart forgets consumed signatures. For production, back this with a durable
 * store (Redis/SQLite) so a proof can't be replayed across restarts - see
 * `docs/PRODUCTION_HARDENING.md` section1.1.
