## Why escrow

A naive **pay-first** flow has the buyer pay, *then* trust the seller to deliver - if the seller takes
the money and delivers nothing, the buyer is out the funds. Escrow flips that to **conditional
settlement**:

```
buyer deposits SOL into a per-order escrow PDA      (funds locked on-chain)
seller delivers the service                          (off-chain)
buyer releases  -> seller is paid                     (buyer confirms delivery)
   ...or...
deadline passes -> buyer refunds                      (seller never delivered)
```

**The base escrow protects the buyer, not the seller.** The seller can't take funds without a `release`,
and the buyer can't claw back before the deadline. But only the **buyer** signs `release`/`refund`, so a
malicious buyer could take delivery, sit out the deadline, and `refund` - the seller delivered for
nothing. So the base escrow alone is **buyer-released**, not seller-protected.

**That's fixed by the arbiter - and it's shipped.** [`programs/arbiter`](programs/arbiter/src/lib.rs) is
a deployed wrapper (`FJtuVXsyXuRKqgJBEPAXmktkd13CqStapgevzGwYktXd`) that uses the vault-as-buyer pattern
(see [`contract_extension.md`](contract_extension.md)): the payer funds a vault PDA that becomes the
escrow's buyer, and a **neutral arbiter** is the only party that can `arbitrate_release` (pay the seller
on verified delivery) or `arbitrate_refund` (return funds to the payer after the deadline). The demo
settles through the arbiter, so the buyer can't take delivery and refund. It is still a *trusted*
third-party arbiter - a single trusted keypair in this demo.

## How it's built

```
escrow/
  Cargo.toml                    the Cargo workspace (escrow + arbiter)
  Anchor.toml
  programs/escrow/src/lib.rs    the settlement spine (initialize / release / refund)
  programs/arbiter/src/lib.rs   the trusted-neutral wrapper (open / arbitrate_release / arbitrate_refund)
  client/escrow.ts              TypeScript client - deposit / release / refund
  tests/escrow.ts               integration tests (lifecycle + security) - run against devnet
  package.json
```

The arbiter's TS client is [`../agent/arbiter.ts`](../agent/arbiter.ts) (bundled IDL at
`../agent/arbiter_idl.json`); the demo's proxy settles through it.

### The program (`lib.rs`)

| Instruction | Who signs | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `initialize(amount, reference, deadline)` | buyer | Creates a per-order escrow PDA and deposits `amount` SOL into it |
| `release()` | buyer | Pays the escrowed `amount` to the seller; closes the escrow (rent -> buyer) |
| `refund()` | buyer | After the `deadline`, returns the whole balance to the buyer |

The escrow PDA is seeded by `[b"escrow", buyer, reference]` - the **`reference`** is the same Solana
Pay key the seller already mints per request, so escrow slots into the existing protocol without a new
identifier.

### Security (from the solana-dev skill's checklist)

- **`init`, never `init_if_needed`** - no reinitialization attacks.
- **Per-(buyer, reference) PDA seeds** - no shared-PDA "master key" across orders.
- **`Signer` + `has_one = buyer` / `has_one = seller`** - only the bound parties can release/refund.
- **`close = buyer`** - secure closure returns rent and prevents account revival.
- **Checked math** on every lamport move.

## Build, test, deploy

Prereqs: Rust, the Solana CLI, and Anchor 0.32.x (`avm install 0.32.1 && avm use 0.32.1`). The
[`solana-dev`](../../../SKILLS.md) skill can set this up and help debug.

```sh
cd examples/txodds/escrow
anchor build                              # compiles the program + generates the IDL & TS types
anchor keys sync                          # set the program id to your keypair's
anchor deploy --provider.cluster devnet   # deploy (needs a funded devnet wallet)

# integration tests against the DEPLOYED program (no local validator needed):
npm install
ANCHOR_PROVIDER_URL=https://api.devnet.solana.com \
ANCHOR_WALLET=$HOME/.config/solana/id.json \
npx ts-mocha -p ./tsconfig.json -t 1000000 tests/escrow.ts
```

> **Windows note:** `anchor build` may emit the IDL but skip the `.so`. If `target/deploy/escrow.so`
> is missing, run `cd programs/escrow && cargo build-sbf` then
> `cp programs/escrow/target/deploy/escrow.so ../../target/deploy/` before `anchor deploy`.
> (Also in `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`.) For fast in-process unit tests, port `tests/escrow.ts` to **LiteSVM**.

## Wiring it into the agent flow

The drop-in change: where the buyer currently **transfers** SOL, it **deposits** into escrow instead,
and **releases** after it has the delivered data.

```ts
import { deposit, release } from './client/escrow'

// buyer-agent, instead of payFromUrl(...):
await deposit(program, buyer, sellerPubkey, reference, amountSol, /* deadline */ 600)
// -> tell the seller "paid via escrow reference=<reference>"
// seller verifies the escrow PDA exists + is funded, then delivers
// buyer, once it has DELIVERED data:
await release(program, buyer, sellerPubkey, reference)
```

The seller-side check changes from "did a transfer land?" to "is there a funded escrow PDA for this
reference, with me as the seller?" - and it only delivers once it sees the deposit. (For a fully
seller-protected delivery proof you'd add an arbiter - see below.)

---

## What you could build on this

The escrow is the foundation; the interesting agent-economy mechanisms are built on top:

| Build | Idea |
|---|---|
| **Dispute / arbiter agent** | Add a third `arbiter` signer that can release-to-seller or refund-to-buyer when the two disagree - a reputation-staked agent that adjudicates delivery |
| **Milestone / streaming payments** | Multiple partial releases as a long task completes, instead of one lump sum - pay an agent as it makes progress |
| **Subscriptions** | A recurring escrow the seller can claim once per period while the buyer keeps it funded |
| **Multi-token settlement** | Escrow **USDC** (or any SPL / Token-2022) instead of SOL for price stability - swap `SystemProgram` transfers for `token_interface` transfers |
| **On-chain agent registry** | A PDA per agent storing identity, accepted tokens, and a **reputation** score - buyers check it before escrowing; releases/refunds update it |
| **x402 facilitator** | Make the program the on-chain verify/settle step of the HTTP 402 flow, replacing any trusted facilitator |
| **Slashing / staking** | Sellers stake into the program; failed deliveries (via the arbiter) slash the stake - Sybil resistance for an open marketplace |

Each of these is a hackathon project in its own right, and the `solana-dev` skill is set up to help
build them (Anchor scaffolding, LiteSVM tests, Codama client generation, the security checklist).

## The honest trade-off

- **Gain:** escrow-protected, buyer-released settlement - conditional, refundable funds instead of
  pay-and-pray. (Seller protection needs the arbiter above; the shipped base contract protects the buyer.)
- **Cost:** it's **Rust**, the one place the kit leaves "TypeScript end-to-end", and it adds a
  build/deploy toolchain - the price of on-chain settlement.
- **Middle ground:** if you only want **price stability** (not conditional settlement), escrow is
  overkill - accept **USDC** via SPL token transfers in the TS flow. Escrow is specifically about
  *conditional release*, not tokens.
